# CS380D_Distributed_Systems
Course repo for CS380D: Distributed Systems

I followed MIT 6.824 and finished their labs that incrementally build a sharded, replicated key/value store service with strong consistency guarantees. The source code is not publicly available per the course requirement. You're welcome to read through the report and hopefully find something useful there; I tried to be explicit for my approach, especially things that have cost me time (you'll probably encounter those questions too when you're doing the lab), so I'm not surprised if you find hints (or even answers) to your questions after reading the report.
